<p>Our case study centers around issues of racial disparity in criminal
sentencing, and is based on research performed by one of this case
study’s authors. Before proceeding, take some time to read the original
study, <a
href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01879-5">Federal
Criminal Sentencing: Race-Based Disparate Impact and Differential
Treatment in Judicial Districts</a>. There may be some things in the
paper that you don’t understand — perhaps just a few, or perhaps many.
That’s ok. The goal of reading the paper is not to understand every
detail, but rather to provide a first exposure to the material you’ll be
working on and to get you excited about it. For convenience, here is the
abstract.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Race-based inequity in federal criminal sentencing is widely
acknowledged, and yet our understanding of it is far from complete.
Inequity may arise from several sources, including direct bias of
courtroom actors and structural bias that produces racially disparate
impacts. Irrespective of these sources, inequity may also originate from
different loci within the federal system. We bring together the
questions of the sources and loci of inequity. The purpose of our study
is to quantify race-based disparate impact and differential treatment at
the national level and at the level of individual federal judicial
districts. We analyze over one-half million sentencing records publicly
available from the United States Sentencing Commission database,
spanning the years 2006 to 2020. At the system-wide level, Black and
Hispanic defendants receive average sentences that are approximately 19
months longer and 5 months longer, respectively. Demographic factors and
sentencing guideline elements account for nearly 17 of the 19 months for
Black defendants and all five of the months for Hispanic defendants,
demonstrating the disparate impact of the system at the national level.
At the individual district level, even after controlling for each
district’s unique demographics and implementation of sentencing factors,
14 districts show significant differences for minoritized defendants as
compared to white ones. These unexplained differences are evidence of
possible differential treatment by judges, prosecutors, and defense
attorneys.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In this case study, we won’t cover all of the results described in
this paper, but we will cover some of the most important ones. Thinking
about the distinction between observational and experimental case
studies, this case study can be viewed as an observational study because
the researchers are attempting to learn about the population of interest
by sampling and observing patterns without manipulating any
variables.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>What are race-based sentencing disparities, and why should we care?
Race-based sentencing disparities in the United States refer to the
marked and consistent differences in the severity and types of sentences
given to individuals of different racial and ethnic backgrounds,
convicted of the same or similar crimes. This disparity has been a
subject of debate and research for many decades, as part of a broader
discourse on racial bias in the criminal justice system. It has been
consistently found that people of color are more likely to receive
harsher sentences than their white counterparts.</p>
<p>This phenomenon can be traced back to the historical context of the
United States. Racial discrimination and bias have been entrenched in
American society, and the criminal justice system is not immune to these
systemic biases. The War on Drugs in the 1980s and 1990s, for example,
disproportionately impacted communities of color, with crack cocaine
offenses (more common among Black communities) punished far more
severely than powder cocaine offenses (more common among white
communities). This is despite the fact that both substances are
pharmacologically identical.</p>
<p>While legal changes have reduced some explicit forms of
discrimination, research suggests that implicit bias and structural
factors continue to contribute to sentencing disparities. For example,
mandatory minimum sentencing laws can disproportionately impact people
of color due to disparities in the types of crimes committed and the
socioeconomic conditions that can lead to criminal behavior.</p>
<p>From a social justice perspective, race-based sentencing disparities
matter significantly. They reflect and perpetuate racial inequity,
undermining the promise of equal treatment under the law that is a
fundamental principle of democratic societies. They erode public trust
in the legal system, making it more difficult for law enforcement and
the courts to function effectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these disparities contribute to the vicious cycle of
systemic racism. Individuals who receive harsher sentences are more
likely to face significant challenges in reintegrating into society
post-incarceration, including limited employment opportunities,
disruptions to family structures, and disenfranchisement. These
challenges can increase the likelihood of recidivism, perpetuating
racial disparities in economic and social outcomes.</p>
<p>The existence of race-based sentencing disparities is a call to
action for policy reform. This may include efforts to reduce mandatory
minimum sentences, increase the use of alternatives to incarceration,
provide bias training for judges and prosecutors, and implement more
transparent, objective sentencing guidelines. Addressing these
disparities is a crucial step toward realizing a more equitable and just
society.</p>
<p>In conclusion, race-based sentencing disparities in the U.S. not only
reflect the systemic racism embedded within the criminal justice system
but also exacerbate social and economic inequalities. Achieving social
justice necessitates a comprehensive and diligent effort to rectify
these disparities, creating a fair, unbiased system that upholds the
tenet of equal treatment for all, regardless of race or ethnicity.
Fixing our biased system can be aided by identifying the loci of racial
inequity, which is the purpose of this case study.</p>

<div id="the-u.s.-federal-court-system" class="section level2">
<h2>The U.S. federal court system</h2>
<p>Before we dive into understanding race-based sentencing disparities
in the United States, let’s understand some important context about the
U.S. federal court system and federal sentencing. The United States
federal court system is, at its core, a three-tiered structure, starting
with district courts at the bottom, circuit courts in the middle, and
the Supreme Court at the top.</p>
<p>The district courts are the workhorses of the federal judiciary,
handling the vast majority of federal cases. There are 94 federal
judicial districts, including one or more districts in each state, as
well as courts for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Three
territories of the United States – the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the
Northern Mariana Islands – have district courts as well.</p>
<p>Above the district courts are the United States courts of appeals.
These courts are divided into 12 regional circuits across America, each
of which hears appeals from the district courts located within its
circuit. There’s also the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which has nationwide jurisdiction to hear appeals in specialized cases,
such as those involving patent laws and cases decided by the U.S. Court
of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p>At the pinnacle of the federal court system is the Supreme Court of
the United States, composed of nine justices. The Supreme Court mainly
hears appeals from the circuit courts and state supreme courts, but it
also has original jurisdiction over a small range of cases.</p>
<p>Federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, are nominated by
the President and confirmed by the Senate. They serve “during good
behavior,” which effectively means they can hold their positions for
life. A federal judge may also exit office through voluntary retirement
or resignation.</p>
<p>However, judges can be removed from office before their term ends if
they’re impeached and convicted. Impeachment is a political process,
initiated by the House of Representatives and decided by the Senate.
Impeachment of federal judges has happened 15 times in U.S. history, and
of these, eight judges have been convicted and removed from office.</p>
<p>As of 2021, there were about 677 federal district court judgeships.
These judges deal with a broad range of cases, including those related
to federal laws, disputes between states, and issues involving the
federal government.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-federal-sentencing-works" class="section level2">
<h2>How federal sentencing works</h2>
<p>In this module, we are considering sentencing patterns, and possible
bias, in criminal cases adjudicated in the federal district courts from
2006–2020. You might wonder what sorts of cases end up in these courts.
The cases are restricted to those that involve federal statutes,
interpretations of the US Constitution, or more than one state.</p>
<p>In criminal cases resulting in a conviction, the crime statute itself
may have sentencing restrictions, but beyond those, a judge has complete
freedom in setting the length of the prison term. We will examine data
at the national level as well as within individual districts, with an
eye for detecting possible racial bias.</p>
<p>In 1987, the United States Sentencing Commission created sentencing
guidelines for Federal Courts. These guidelines prescribe a range of
possible prison terms, taking into account both the severity of the
crime and the prior criminal history of the defendant, as well as
numerous possible mitigating factors (ones that may call for shortening
the sentence) and aggravating factors (ones that may call for
lengthening the sentence). Although these guidelines were initially
mandatory, a 2005 Supreme Court ruling changed them to being only
advisory, returning great freedom in sentencing to each individual
judge.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-to-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to the data</h2>
<p>We will analyze the over one-half million sentencing records spanning
the years 2006 to 2020 provided by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
Publicly available data is usually quite messy, with many missing and
ambiguous entries. For this reason, you will be using a curated copy,
that is, one that has been “cleaned up” (directions for obtaining the
curated copy is in the following section of this module). The sentence
lengths we are using are given in months and do not include probation
nor alternative confinement. Since our aim is to compare lengths of
prison sentences imposed, we have eliminated from the data set any cases
involving non-citizens–those sentences frequently involve deportation,
which is not comparable to prison terms. We combined the information
from some variables (creating new variables) and eliminated incomplete
data items, that is entire records, for defendants for whom we are not
given sufficient information. We have eliminated the (relatively few)
records with sentence lengths of more than 470 months, but retained
those with life sentences, which have been coded by the Commission as
470 months. Finally, because there are very few defendants sentenced in
the district court of the Northern Mariana Islands, those items were
also eliminated.</p>
<p>The data come from two sources: the pre-sentencing report and the
Statement of Reasons. The pre-sentencing report is prepared by the
District’s Probation Office and based on a post-trial, pre-sentencing
investigation including an interview with the defendant. A draft of this
report is issued to the attorneys for comments and corrections and a
final version is given to the attorneys and judge. The Statement of
Reasons is a form filled out by the judge explaining/supporting the
sentence imposed.</p>
<div id="explanation-of-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Explanation of variables</h3>
<p>The two main variables used in the non-mandatory guidelines for
sentencing are criminal history (<code>criminal_history</code>) and an
indicator of the severity of the crime (<code>all_adjustments</code>).
The two variables are combined, using a table, to determine the
recommended range of the sentence.</p>
<p>The variable <code>criminal_history</code> is coded as a value 1 to
6. Prior convictions are assigned points depending on the number of
prior convictions, length(s) of sentence(s), and whether or not past
crimes involved violence. The points are then summed and translated into
a criminal history category represented by the
<code>criminal_history</code> values 1 through 6. A value of 1, for
example, would refer to a defendant with at most one conviction, where
that conviction resulted in a sentence of less than 60 days. As an
additional example, a defendant who has three prior convictions with
sentences of over 13 months and two with sentences between 2 and 13
months would be assigned a total of 13 points, yielding the criminal
history category 6. With only one prior conviction of each type, the
category would be 3. The calculation is not quite this simple, with many
adjustments and some types of convictions and very old convictions being
ignored.</p>
<p>The variable <code>all_adjustments</code> is a rating of the
<em>offense level</em> (how severe the crime is) with
<em>adjustments</em> (added considerations that call for higher or lower
offense level), as defined by the US Sentencing Commission’s Sentencing
Guidelines Manual and interpreted by the US Probation Office and/or the
Presiding Judge. There are 43 levels where, for example, first degree
murder has a base level (that is, level prior to adjustments) of 43 and
trespassing has a base level of 4. Two additional variables,
<code>base_chapter2_adjustments</code> and
<code>base_chapter2_3_adjustments</code>, have to do with the derivation
of <code>all_adjustments</code>, but you can ignore these variables for
the purposes of this case study.</p>
<p>Apart from <code>criminal_history</code> and
<code>all_adjustments</code>, there are several variables related to the
identity of defendants:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>age</code>, which refers to a defendant’s age in years.</li>
<li><code>sex</code>, which has been coded as a binary variable 0 and 1,
where 0 is “Male” and 1 is “Female”.</li>
<li><code>educ</code>, which refers to a defendant’s educational
attainment which consists of 4 levels (1 refers to a defendant having
less than high school graduation, 3 refers to a high school graduate, 5
means having some college, and 6 means college graduate), and</li>
<li><code>race</code>, which refers to a defendant’s race and has levels
“black”, “hispanic”, “white” and “other”.</li>
</ul>
<p>A key motivation for this work is exploring how our personal and
racial identities influence the judicial sentencing. In a fair,
democratic system this identity or perceived identity should not affect
how we are treated by the justice system. It is important to note that
these characteristics are not independent of one another but can
intersect and interact with one another. This combined effect is known
as intersectionality. The Center for Intersectional Justice describes
the concept of intersectionality as: “the ways in which systems of
inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender
identity, disability, class and other forms of discrimination
‘intersect’ to create unique dynamics and effects” (Ref: <a
href="https://www.intersectionaljustice.org/what-is-intersectionality">Center
for Intersectional Justice</a>, July 20, 2023).</p>
<p>Let’s take a moment to also consider how these identity-based
variables were defined. Sex, for example, is defined in a pre-sentencing
report that comes out of the investigation done by the probation office.
This goes to the attorneys and also comes out of an interview with the
individual. It should be noted that there are only two categories, so it
is likely that there might be only two options possible for the
individual. Not only is this challenging in that it restricts a
defendant’s identity to two rigid categories, but a binary variable will
not reflect sentenced individuals’ gender identity and excludes several
groups, such as non-binary individuals, altogether. Therefore, a
limitation of this study comes through in the “levels” of each variable
being predetermined by the data-collecting institutions we are relying
on. It is critical that in such instances we not only acknowledge this
limitation, but contextualize our analysis and inferences with this
knowledge.</p>
<!-- Attempted to write this section above, but could clarify/add based on these notes:
- See Background section or link to official report for more information
- Discuss how a binary variable will not reflect sentenced individuals gender identity and excludes several groups. It is also limiting in nature.
- Discuss difference between sex and gender
- Discuss who has defined this variable and why this is problematic
- Discuss the limitations and how this affects the analysis and inferences we can make.
- Update sex label with more appropriate label based on Background research. 

Also to possibly add: explaining why we are going to use "ARI" rather than "other" for the race category -->
<p>The nine other variables in the data set refer to information about
the court cases themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>year</code>, which describes the year in which the court case
took place,</li>
<li><code>sentence_length</code>, the length prescribed to a defendant
in months,</li>
<li><code>guilty_plea</code>, where 0 means the defendant did not plead
guilty and 1 means the defendant did plead guilty,
<!-- check this! --></li>
<li><code>grid_cell</code>, which is a term that represents the
interaction between <code>criminal_history</code> and
<code>all_adjustments</code>,</li>
<li><code>mandatory_min</code>, which signifies whether or not the court
case included a mandatory minimum sentence,</li>
<li><code>gov_departures</code>, which tracks government sponsored
downward departures, and</li>
<li><code>district</code>, which refers to the district where the trial
took place.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you work through the analyses in this case study, you might return
to this background information as needed to remind yourself of the
context of the data.</p>
